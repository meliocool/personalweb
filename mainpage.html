                <img src = "assets/TWICEScientist-scaled.jpg">
                <p> K-POP is one of my core interest, i listen to it a lot and i also take inspirations from their 
                    group or agency's websites and apps. One of my ultimate group is TWICE and my bias is Yoo Jeongyeon :D.
                    A few iconic TWICE songs that i listen to while making this website are "UP NO MORE" and their newest release
                    "I GOT YOU".

                <img src = "assets/elden-ring-ranni-elden-ring-hd-wallpaper-preview.jpg">
                <p> Ah yes, the mainstream hobby of 90% of Computer Science students, including me :D. I enjoy a few 
                    Single-Player story games namely "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" and ALL games developed by
                    FromSoftware. I'm also taking into consideration my interest in video games could potentially lead me to a game developing career.

                <img src = "assets/ichigoat2.jpg">
                <p> An even more mainstream hobby of Computer Science students. You probably guessed from my appearance that i am a weeb myself. 
                    Some anime that i have watched includes Bleach, Evangelion, and some Romance anime that i can talk about for hours. Fun fact, i never went to 
                    any weeb events, and i take a huge pride in that :D.
